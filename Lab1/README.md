# Lab 1
## Buzzy Defender
This is the first lab for ECE4122/6122 using SFML. The goal of this lab is to create a simple game where the player controls buzzy character that must defend against incoming enemies. The player can move the buzzy left and right and shoot lasers to destroy the enemies. The game ends when an buzzy takes 3 hits or the enemy reaches the top of the screen.

### Build Instructions
To build the project, navigate to the `Lab1` directory and run the following commands:
```bash
./build.sh
```
This will create a `build` directory and compile the project. The compiled binary will be located in `../build/output/bin/Lab1`.

### Run Instructions
To run the game, execute the following command from the `Lab1` directory:
```bash
./run.sh
```

### Clean Instructions
To clean up the build artifacts, run the following command from the `Lab1` directory:
```bash
./clean.sh
``` 
This will remove the `build` directory and the compiled binary.
